* **Explanation of Design Choices**



1. **Why worded this way?**

&nbsp; I wanted to go beyond “assistant” language and make it feel like a real teacher-student interaction. Using metaphors (mentor, muscle-building, finger-pointing) creates a unique, human-like teaching style.



**2. How it avoids giving the solution?**

&nbsp;  By directly instructing the AI to ask questions and suggest directions, but never to “fix” the code. It shifts the focus from answer-giving to dialogue-guiding.



**3. How it encourages helpful feedback?**

&nbsp;  The mentor-style role makes feedback feel less like a machine response and more like a patient teacher nudging the student toward discovery.



* **Reasoning**



1. **Tone and Style:**

&nbsp;  Warm, conversational, and encouraging—like a mentor. The AI should sound curious and supportive, not robotic.



**2. Balance between identifying bugs and guiding:**

&nbsp;  Instead of just pointing out bugs, the AI uses guiding questions (e.g., “What value does this function return here?”). This balances direction with student independence.



**3. Beginner vs. Advanced learners:**



&nbsp;  Beginners: The AI should ask simpler guiding questions and maybe suggest easy debugging tools (like print statements).



&nbsp;  Advanced learners: The AI can challenge them with deeper “what if” scenarios, efficiency concerns, or best practice nudges.



* **Submission Checklist**



&nbsp;Prompt uses a unique metaphor (mentor beside student)



&nbsp;Encourages guiding questions, not just hints



&nbsp;Clear reasoning that emphasizes originality



&nbsp;Beginner vs. advanced adaptation included
